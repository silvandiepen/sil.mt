# About me

So yes, my name is Sil van Diepen. I'm a "creative frontend developer", which I see as a frontend developer who's focussed on the visual and animation part of frontend development.

I currently live with my wife and little son in a small city in the Netherlands called Alkmaar, but soon we will be living on an island somewhere far away.
