## Interests

Photography

: <sil-icon-camera style=" margin: 0; font-size: 3em; position: absolute; transform: translateX(calc(-100% - var(--space)))"></sil-icon-camera> I've been taking pictures since I got my first camera from my grandma at age 8. Since then, it's been on and off. I have times I take lots of pictures and times I really don't do much. But it's recurring and really love photography.

Code Projects

: <sil-icon-terminal style="margin: 0; font-size: 3em; position: absolute; transform: translateX(calc(-100% - var(--space)))"></sil-icon-terminal> When I have time, I build little projects to make my life or work easier. Or sometimes just to learn new techologies. [Projects](https://sil.mt/work/project)

Food & Cooking

: <sil-icon-burger style="margin: 0; font-size: 3em; position: absolute; transform: translateX(calc(-100% - var(--space)))"></sil-icon-burger> A man (and his family) has got to eat! Considering we have to make food every day, I made it into a passion. Especially spices and mixing things have my interest. [Cooking With Sil](https://recipes.sil.mt)

Animals
