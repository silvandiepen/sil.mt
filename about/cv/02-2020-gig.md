## Gaming Innovation Group
### Senior Frontend Developer

Gig gave me the oppurtunity to come and work in Malta. Besides that, GiG was my introduction into the iGaming world. At GiG I was working in a team working on the GiG Whitelabel sportsbook frontend. Where we were working on a solution based on React and moving this to Vue.
