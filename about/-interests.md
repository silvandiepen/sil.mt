## Interests

Photography

: I've been taking pictures since I got my first camera from my grandma at age 8. Since then, it's been on and off. I have times I take lots of pictures and times I really don't do much. But it's recurring and really love photography. [Photography](https://sil.mt/work/photography)

Illustration

: From the moment I could hold anything to draw with, I've been drawing figures and characters. [Illustration](https://sil.mt/work/illustration)

Code Projects

: When I have time, I build little projects to make my life or work easier. Or sometimes just to learn new techologies. [Projects](https://sil.mt/projects)

Food & Cooking

: A man (and his family) has got to eat! Considering we have to make food every day, I made it into a passion. Especially spices and mixing things have my interest. [Cooking With Sil](https://recipes.sil.mt)

Animals

: Grew up with many animals at home, from fish, dogs, chicken, rabbits, etc. Always loved animals and being busy with them. One day... I will have my own zoo.
