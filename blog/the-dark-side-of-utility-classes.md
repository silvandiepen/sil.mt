# The Dark Side of Utility Classes: Why They Might Not Be the Best Solution

Utility classes have gained popularity in recent years due to their perceived benefits in saving time and effort. However, beneath their seemingly innocuous surface lies a complex web of issues that can ultimately harm your project's maintainability, scalability, and overall quality.

In this article, we'll delve into the pros and cons of utility classes, exploring why they might not be the best solution for your project. We'll examine the consequences of relying heavily on utility classes, including their impact on design consistency, accessibility, and maintenance challenges.

## The Pros: Quick Solutions and Reduced Custom Code

Utility classes do offer some benefits, such as:

* Providing quick solutions to common layout issues
* Reducing the need for custom code

However, these advantages come at a cost. The reliance on utility classes can lead to a more fragmented, less maintainable codebase.

## The Cons: Fragmented Codebase and Maintenance Challenges

Utility classes often result in a series of problems that can be difficult to resolve:

1. **Design Logic in Markup**: Utility classes violate the separation of concerns principle by injecting design logic into the markup.
2. **Code Bloat**: Utility classes can lead to bloated HTML, resulting from repeated use and increased file size.
3. **Inconsistent Design Language**:
	* **Incoherent Styles**: Overuse of utility classes leads to inconsistent application of design principles, resulting in a disjointed user experience.
	* **Difficulty in Ensuring Consistency**: It becomes harder to ensure consistent styling across a large project when different developers apply utility classes based on
their interpretations.
4. **Poor Reusability**:
	* **Limited Extensibility**: Utility classes can be limiting when you need to build more complex or responsive designs.
	* **Impact on Accessibility**: Over-reliance on visual styling alone might not translate well for screen readers or other assistive technologies.
5. **Maintenance Challenges**:
	* **Harder to Track Changes**: If utility classes are used extensively, tracking down where styles are applied and making updates can be difficult.
	* **Scalability Issues**: As the project grows, the number of utility classes can become overwhelming, making it difficult to manage and scale the codebase effectively.

## The Consequences: Inconsistent Design, Accessibility Issues, and Maintenance Nightmares

Relying heavily on utility classes can lead to a series of consequences that can ultimately harm your project's maintainability, scalability, and overall quality:

* **Inconsistent Design**: Overuse of utility classes leads to inconsistent application of design principles, resulting in a disjointed user experience.
* **Accessibility Issues**: Utility classes often rely on visual styling alone, which might not translate well for screen readers or other assistive technologies.
* **Maintenance Nightmares**: The reliance on utility classes can make it difficult to track changes, update styles, and manage the codebase effectively.

## Use mixins instead

You like using the utility classes but agree with the above points about bloating the html and separation of concerns, but you still want to have some sort of utility classes because it makes your live somewhat easier. A simple example for that could for instance be a few lines of code which makes your text truncate instead of falling on another line. The utility class for that could look like this;

```css
.truncate{
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

Instead of applying the .truncate class on the html, bloating up the html you could also do the following;

@extend it.
```css
.my-element__label{
	@extend .truncate;
}
```

@mixin it.
```css
@mixin truncate {
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}

.my-element__label{
	@include truncate();
}
```

In both ways, all the styling for the element will be still together. Therefor it is easier to see in your style files what is actually going on with that element, instead that it is spread. 

In the case of the @extend, the element class will be added to the truncate and the rendered css will look as follows;
```
.truncate, .my-element__label {
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```
For the mixin variant, the css will be a little cleaner and becomes just this;
```
.my-element__label {
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

## The additional bonus of Unique Selectors

In the case that you work really heavily with the utility classes and do not always even have specific selectors for elements. It also makes it harder to go through a project based on classes. Finding which component does a certain thing based on the html becomes a lot harder. Whenever the html is clean and the html classes only exists out of bemm classes, practically every element will get it's own unique identifier. This makes it a lot easier to search through the code and find that specific class. 

Good luck finding this element;
```
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md max-w-sm mx-auto">
  <span class="text-blue-600 font-bold text-lg tracking-wide uppercase">Hello, World!</span>
</div>

```
But this is a lot easier to find.
```
<div class="card">
  <span class="card__text">Hello, World!</span>
</div>
```


## Alternative Approaches: BEM and Atomic CSS

In light of these challenges, consider alternative approaches like:

1. **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)**: A structurally organized approach that separates presentation logic from the markup.
2. **Atomic Design**: A technique that breaks down complex designs into reusable, modular units.

These methods can help you:

1. **Structurally Organize Your Code**: By separating presentation logic from the markup.
2. **Maintain Consistent Design**: Through a unified design system and consistent styling principles.
3. **Improve Reusability**: By encapsulating styles within components or using modular approaches.

**Conclusion**

Utility classes, while seemingly convenient, can lead to a more fragmented, less maintainable codebase. The consequences of relying heavily on utility classes include inconsistent design, accessibility issues, and maintenance nightmares.

By considering alternative approaches like BEM and Atomic Design, you can create a more structurally organized, consistent, and maintainable codebase that ultimately benefits your project's scalability, quality, and overall success.
